The dataset involved is "NBA Database" available on Kaggle (which is updated regularly). Presently, it includes 64000+ games, 4800+ games and 30 teams. From this dataset, 'games.csv' was used for our particilar task.

Missing Value Treatment - 
A thorough analysis of missing values was conducted across all features. The percentage of missing values was calculated for each variable, and features with more than 10% missing data were removed from the dataset to maintain data integrity and avoid potential bias in subsequent analyses.

Data Type Optimization - 
The game_date feature was converted from object to datetime format to enable proper temporal analysis and sorting operations.

Feature Engineering and Encoding -
The categorical features wl_home and wl_away (win/loss indicators) were converted into two new numerical features:
Winner: Team ID of the winning team
Loser: Team ID of the losing team
Redundant features were removed which include wl_home, wl_away, team_name_home, and team_name_away.

Data Organization -
The final preprocessed dataset was sorted chronologically by game_date to allow time-series analysis and maintain data flow for future modeling and visualization tasks.

Elo Rating System Implementation -
Taking inspiration from chess, an Elo rating was implemented to measure team strength and performance throughout the dataset. Both global and surface-specific ratings are calculated using a K-factor of 32 and initial rating of 1000 points. For each game, pre-match Elo ratings for both teams are used to compute expected win probabilities using the standard Elo formula, and are then updated based on the actual outcome. Separate rating tracks were maintained for different playing surfaces and forms six new features: pre-game global ratings for winners and losers (winner_elo_pre, loser_elo_pre), the rating differential (elo_diff), and corresponding surface-specific metrics (winner_elo_surf_pre, loser_elo_surf_pre, elo_surf_diff).

Head-to-Head Historical Feature Engineering -
The head-to-head (H2H) historical performance tracker measures the peformance of teams against each other. A nested dictionary records win counts between all team pairs throughout the dataset. For every game, the function captures pre-match score by calculating the difference between historical difference of wins between the two teams. Then it is updated based on match result. This generates h2h_pre feature, which represents the historical competitive advantage one team holds over another before each game.

Recent Form Analysis Feature -
For each game, the last 10 games are checked. THe difference between the win counts of the two teams over these matches is calculated. This generates the `recent_form_diff` feature which indicates the difference between the recent forms of the two teams involved.

Categorical Variable Encoding -
The categorical features present in the dataset were converted to numerical format using the fit_transform method. This converted string categories into numerical codes. This was done to make th data compatible with machine learning algorithms.

Proposed Model: Stacking Ensemble Classifier -
The final predictive model employs a stacking ensemble classifier architecture which combines multiple diverse base learners to improve accuracy. The proposed architecture involves three base learners: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier (100 estimators) and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The meta-features generated by the base learners are fed into the Logistic Regression meta learner. This two-level learning approach is the basis of our algorithm.
